# Gauss Elimination Implementation Step 2

You are given a pair of matrices, $A$ and $B$, where
matrix $A$ is an upper-triangular matrix with a unit diagonal.

Your task is to implement the second stage of Gauss 
Elimination (to eliminate the upper triangle in the 
matrix $A$).

This step is significantly simplier than the Step 1 as divisons with zero cannot happen here.

## Some hints

The algorithm should perform same linear combinations of
rows of both left-hand side and right-hand side matrices.

Note that all matrices should be converted to float in the beginning of the algorithm.
