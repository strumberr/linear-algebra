# Solving System of Linear Equations (SLE)

You are given a square right hand side matrix $A$ and 
a left hand side vector $b$.

Using Gauss Algorithm Stages 1 and 2, write a function
that solve SLE $A \mathbf x = \mathbf b$.

Your function should return the solution $\mathbf x$.

## What's the point?

The functions above were stress-tested for some of the
cases. Now we can try to solve some real problems with
their help.

If you see that you are capabile of solving SLEs with
the functions that you have implemented, it is more
likely that you do not have any bugs in your implemtations.

Besides, you have also practiced solving SLEs with
Gauss Elimination that is one of the applications of
it in Linear Algebra.

Note that we are now capable of solving SLEs of size
$100 \times 100$ (!!!) and larger automatically.
