# Numpy dot-product operator

In `numpy` there is a dot-product operator. To calculate
dot product of matrices `A` and `B`, you should run: 
`A @ B`, where `@` suddenly is an operator, like `+` or
`*`.

## Task

You are given two matrices `A` and `B` in a form 
of `numpy.ndarray`. The task is to calculate the product
`A @ B` using the standard `numpy` dot-product operator: `@`. 
Consider the shapes of matrices
are such that you can perform dot-product.

## Interface

**Input**: `A, B: numpy.ndarrays`

**Output**: `C: numpy.ndarray`
