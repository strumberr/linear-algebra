# Gramm Matrix I

You are given a vector $\mathbf x$ in form of set of 
coordinates in basis $B$ that is given as 
coordinates of vectors in some orthonormal basis:

$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
- & \mathbf b_1 & - \\
- & \mathbf b_2 & - \\
  & \vdots & - \\
- & \mathbf b_N & - 
\end{bmatrix}$$

Find covariant coordinates of a vector $\mathbf x$ in that
basis.
