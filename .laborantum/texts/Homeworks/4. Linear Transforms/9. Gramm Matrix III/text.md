# Gramm Matrix III

You are given a pair of vectors $\mathbf x, \mathbf y$ in form of set of **covariant** 
coordinates in basis $B$ that is given as 
coordinates of vectors in some orthonormal basis:

$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
- & \mathbf b_1 & - \\
- & \mathbf b_2 & - \\
  & \vdots & - \\
- & \mathbf b_N & - 
\end{bmatrix}$$

Find scalar product $\left<\mathbf x, \mathbf y\right>$. 
Note that the answer should be very simple.
