# Change of Basis

You are given a vector $\mathbf x$ as coordinates in some 
basis. You are also given new basis vectors as coordinates
of new basis vectors in old basis $B$:

$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
- & \mathbf b_1 & - \\
- & \mathbf b_2 & - \\
  & \vdots & - \\
- & \mathbf b_N & - 
\end{bmatrix}$$

Find coordinates of vector $\mathbf x$ in new basis.
