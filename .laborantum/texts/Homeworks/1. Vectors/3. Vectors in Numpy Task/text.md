# Vectors in Numpy

`numpy` is one of the most important libraries that are used
for Scientific Computing. It operates with vectors, matrices
and tensors. In our course we will use this library for 
advanced programming assignments.

To create a vector in Numpy, one have to define a list of
coordinates of a vector and then call the constructor of
the array with coordinates as arguments like this:

```python
coords = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
vect = numpy.array(coords)
```

# Task

Your task is to create the following vectors with `numpy`:

1. <img src="images\img.png" width="350" />
2. <img src="images\img_1.png" width="350" />
3. <img src="images\img_2.png" width="350" />
4. <img src="images\img_3.png" width="350" />
