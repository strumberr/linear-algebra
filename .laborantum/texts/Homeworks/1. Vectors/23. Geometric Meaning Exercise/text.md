# Geometric meaning of Scalar Product

## Task

Calculate scalar product for a pair of vectors  
$\mathbf x$ and $\mathbf y$ and
length of projection of $\mathbf x$ on $\mathbf y$, 
if you know the lengths of the vector and
the angle between the vectors:

$|\mathbf x| = 4$

$|\mathbf y| = 3$

$\phi = \frac{\pi}{6}$
